Project based on machine learning and django about the intrusion detection system

Basically the intrusion detection about the unauthorized activities like making the server down via dos attack or ddos and other network 
attacks that create the limitations on resorces . that is where the IDS plays an important role in keeping the network free from intruders 
and making the network free from unauthrizer .

  The project consists of machine learning model which implemented using the Neural Network Model(Multi Level Perceptron) . The model is
  use to detect the attack by pattern matching of the behaviour of user and the web implementation is for user convenience . 
  
  We have use the Django to implement the User Interface and the intregration is quiet is easy with the django and machine learning .
